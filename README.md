## Major Project Description:
### Group work
#### For this creative coding project, our team chose ‘Wheel of Fortune’ by Pacita Abad.Pacita Abad used the stippling technique in this piece of artwork, which is a subtle blend of colours, patterns and textures, with a circular wheel as the main element, suggesting the themes of luck, destiny and the cycle of life.

#### We do this by constructing core elements consisting of inner concentric circles and outer dots. At the same time, we combined the Dunhuang colour scheme to adjust the colours, consider a reasonable structure, and reduce the proportion of the elements. In the end, we created a more elegant work that is as close to the original as possible.
