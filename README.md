## Major Project Description:
### Group work
#### For this creative coding project, our team chose ‘Wheel of Fortune’ by Pacita Abad.Pacita Abad used the stippling technique in this piece of artwork, which is a subtle blend of colours, patterns and textures, with a circular wheel as the main element, suggesting the themes of luck, destiny and the cycle of life.
